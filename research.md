* **Transparent Reinforcement Learning:** Deep Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a powerful technique to train agents to carry out specific tasks. But we still do not know why an agent takes a bad action due to the non-interpretability of deep neural networks. Some recent works have been carried out on making RL agents' actions interpretable like [Object Sensitive Deep Reinforcement Learning by Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06064).

* **Imitation Learning with Observations:** In Imitation Learning, we need to give state, action pairs of an expert

* **Reinforcement Learning for Block Sparsity Pruning in Deep Neural Networks for Model Compression:**

* **Hindsight Experience Replay with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning:**
