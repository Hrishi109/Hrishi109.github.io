'We attempt to solve the online version of the 3D bin-packing problem using reinforcement learning. Our method-PackMan beats heuristical methods in solving the task of filling the containers with boxes without the knowledge of the order of incoming box dimensions.'[**[Demo]**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ5iZTnsQI76zvZ6CLopwNTYL6vDvG_/view?usp=sharing)[Download paper here](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper2.pdf)
