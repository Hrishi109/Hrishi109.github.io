We attempt to solve the online version of the 3D bin-packing problem using reinforcement learning. Our method-PackMan beats heuristical methods in solving the task of filling the containers with boxes without the knowledge of the order of incoming box dimensions.[**[PDF]**](https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1XjGhJ_4zmKgbX37RikYqVWMkGC_hYTF4/view?usp=sharing) [**[Demo]**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ5iZTnsQI76zvZ6CLopwNTYL6vDvG_/view?usp=sharing)
