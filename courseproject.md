### Reinforcement Learning:
**Robust Reinforcement Learning**

**Author:** Rishhanth Maanav V and Siddharth Nayak

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning agents have been used for a wide range of tasks, such as games and robotic control.The agent tries to learn policies and value functions through trial and error by interacting with the environment until it converges to an optimal policy. Robustness and stability are quite critical in Reinforcement Learning; however, neural networks are vulnerable to noise from unexpected sources and are not likely to withstand disturbances. Also, whenever robots are trained with Reinforcement Learning agents, they are generally either initialized with hand-made policies or policies from simulated agents. The simulated agents,however may not capture all of the noise in a real-world robot. Thus, the transfer learning may not be efficient enough for faster convergence on robots. In this paper we evaluate two robust reinforcement learning algorithms and compare them along with the vanilla algorithm and a naive algorithm described further in the paper. The main idea in this paper is that we can use adversarial examples to choose perturbations duringthe training of the agent. In this paper we try to implement the robust reinforcement learning algorithmssimulated in OpenAI Gym and MujoCo Environments with perturbations in the observations. We use the Reacher-V2 environment of OpenAI Gym with MujoCo backend for our evaluation. [**[Course Project]**](https://github.com/nsidn98/Robust-Reinforcement-Learning)
