I am interested in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and Robust Control Theory and I want to contribute something to the world by making new technological products.

Some of the Research Problems I am currently interested in:

* Transparent Reinforcement Learning: Deep Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a powerful technique to train agents to carry out specific tasks. But we still do not know why an agent takes a bad action due to the non-interpretability of deep neural networks. Some recent works have been carried out on making RL agents' actions interpretable like [Object Sensitive Deep Reinforcement Learning by Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06064).

* Imitation Learning with
