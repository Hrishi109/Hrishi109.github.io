The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool -Richard Feynman

I am interested in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and Robust Control Theory and I want to contribute something to the world by making new technological products.


## Interests and Hobbies:

### Sports
- #### Cricket
    It is the most followed sport in India and almost every kid in India plays cricket atleast once in their childhood. In my case, I started playing with a leather ball when I was in my 7th grade. Cricket was a stress-buster during my schooling years.
- #### Water Polo 
    A sport I learned after coming to IIT Madras in my second year. Fell in love with the speed of the game. A difficult sport to learn (Even basic floating was hard initially!). Water Polo has helped me improve my stamina and endurance.      
- #### Formula 1
    The pinnacle of motorsports! I have been watching F1 since my childhood and this was one of the things which motivated me to take up engineering. The amount of engineering which goes into making the cars faster even on tricky street circuits like Monaco has always fascinated me. My favourite constructor has been [Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport](https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/en/) ever since it (re-)entered F1 in 2010 with Michael Schumacher after taking over Brawn GP. 
- #### Other sports I follow
    - Football: Liverpool and Bayern M&uuml;nchen
    - Tennis: Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic (I know they are rivals!)

### Music 
- #### Instruments
    I learned to play the harmonium from my grandfather and then later by attending classes. This eventually led me to learn to play the piano. This change was initially quite difficult as one plays a harmonium with only one hand (right in my case) whereas piano is played with both hands. I would definitely like to learn a few other instruments like violin.
- #### Bands/Artists
    I do like a lot of genres: ranging from rap to rock. My favorite artists include Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, One Republic, The Score, The Script, Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses and Eminem.
    I also like theme songs and scores from Hans Zimmer, Ramin Djawadi , Brian Tyler ([F1 theme!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AYy-BcjRXg)), Ludwig G&ouml;ransson and Alan Silvestri.
    
### Language
I can speak [6 languages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLh826hWjfB9WzqxdRMtBk1tdjcRABrI/view?usp=sharing) (and understand 7).

### Sketching
A few of my [sketches](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10i5ru6oahtPOYvSR3Yadbabe0xIXm_x9?usp=sharing). Sketching has helped me a lot in appreciating the fine details (see: Ironman sketches).
