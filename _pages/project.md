## A Generalized Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Online 5D Bin-Packing:
### Author: Richa Verma, Aniruddha Singhal, Harshad Khadilkar, Ansuma Basumatary, Siddharth Nayak, Harsh Vardhan Singh, Swagat Kumar and Rajesh Sinha
#### Accepted at the AAAI'20 workshop on [Generalization in Planning (GenPlan)](https://sites.google.com/view/genplan20/home/accepted-papers?authuser=0)
We attempt to solve the online version of the 3D bin-packing problem using reinforcement learning. Our method-PackMan beats heuristical methods in solving the task of filling the containers with boxes without the knowledge of the order of incoming box dimensions.[**[PDF]**](https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1XjGhJ_4zmKgbX37RikYqVWMkGC_hYTF4/view?usp=sharing) [**[Demo]**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ5iZTnsQI76zvZ6CLopwNTYL6vDvG_/view?usp=sharing)

## Robust Reinforcement Learning:
### Authors: Rishhanth Maanav V and **Siddharth Nayak**
We implement two robust reinforcement learning algorithms: Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) by Pinto et al. and Adversarial Robust Policy Learning (ARPL) by Mandlekar et al. and compare them with na&iuml;ve and vanilla reinforcement learning algorithms on different amounts of perturbations while testing.

## Hand Gesture Recognition for Soldier Support:
### Author: **Siddharth Nayak**

I created a hand-gesture recognition glove which recognises the gestures given in this [link](https://github.com/nsidn98/Gesture-Recognition/blob/master/Images/gestures.jpg). This does not use computer vision and instead uses readings from sensors attached to the glove.

## Automatic Waste Segregation Dustbin:
### Project Members: Varun Sundar, Arvind Pujari,**Siddharth Nayak**, Rohith Srinivas, Vishnu Harshith, Sai Venkat, Iniyan Ram
We created an automatic waste segregation dustbin which classifies the waste into distinct categories using features learned from images, the capacitances and the inductances of the waste. The dustbin also has a mechanical disc powered by stepper motors which push the waste into its corresponding compartment after the classification.

## Self- Balancing Robot
### Project Members: **Siddharth Nayak**, Rahul Chakwate, Adil Shaikh, Anuj Sindgi, Atharva Rajadnya
Self-Balancing Robot was the first tech-project I worked on. It is basically a one wheeled robot which balances itself to stay upright. It is like the real-life version of the Cartpole from OpenAI Gym. The robot balances itself using a tuned Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) Controller. The angles of inclination and the angular velocities are given as the state vector. I learnt a lot about electronics, robotics and programming while working on this project.[**[Code]**](https://github.com/nsidn98/One-Wheeled-Balancing-Robot)


## Mini Projects:
### A list of small projects which required less than a week to work on:
* [**Bass Booster**](https://github.com/nsidn98/Bass-Booster): A pythonic way to overlay another layer of bass in audio files. I was motivated to try out this after hearing this [bass boosted version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmITSg23CTY) of Attention by Charlie Puth. Can also extend this to make a treble booster.

* [**DeepTraffic**](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/) is a deep reinforcement learning competition. The goal is to create a neural network to drive a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) as fast as possible through dense traffic. I got a rank of 3203 out of 24,449 participants with a speed of 69.18 mph.[**[Code]**](https://github.com/nsidn98/DeepTraffic-MIT)

* **MouseCam**: MouseCam is a small device I made to control a computer mouse with our thumb, index and middle finger. There are two ways to control the mouse:
  - Control with a webcam which will detect fingers and track them according to colors. This requires a person to wear small wearables of different colors on their fingers. 
  - Control with the device which has an Inertial Measurement Unit and push buttons to control the motion of the mouse pointer. 
The mouse is basically controlled with the movement of the hand. The mouse pointer almost mimics the movement of the hand. [**[Code]**](https://github.com/nsidn98/Mouse-cam)

* **Music with Numbers**: I like to play piano when I am bored or want to cheer myself. I was intrigued by Beethoven's music and saw a video about the math behind some of his musical masterpieces. So I wrote a small piece of code to convert the first few digits of ![pi](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi) and ![e](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e) to music on different pentatonic scales. Different scales can be chosen to make the music with numbers. Here are examples of music generated from [pi](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqlR9W704Lurq1qHxuNgQ2DjXlNhA3L8/view?usp=sharing) and [e](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BCA1s1jsqApCm0oZtBV60-okhJHtmDkn/view?usp=sharing).

* **Games**: A few of the games implemented 
  - Conway's Game of Life
  - Car Racer: The video game of traversing a car through a road just like the DeepTraffic Competition.
  - Maze Solver: Solves mazes with input image
