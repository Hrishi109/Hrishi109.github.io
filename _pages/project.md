## Object Tracking with Reinforcement Learning (2024)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Designed and implemented an Action-Decision Network integrating Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning to achieve real-time object tracking. This approach was 3x faster than traditional object tracking algorithms, optimizing performance for high-speed environments.

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Mixed Autonomy Traffic Management (2024)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing mixed autonomy traffic scenarios involving connected vehicles and human drivers. Focused on traffic throughput optimization, fairness, and real-time adaptability in varying traffic conditions.

## Motion Planning for Dynamic Systems Using OMPL (2024)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Implemented motion planning algorithms such as RRT, KPIECE, and RG-RRT for torque-controlled pendulum and car-like vehicles. Integrated state validity checkers and reachability analysis to optimize path generation under control constraints. Performed benchmarking to evaluate planners on computation time, path length, success rate, and tree size.

## Nonconvex Trajectory Optimization (2023)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Designed an optimization-based framework for nonconvex trajectory generation, enabling real-time performance in robotics applications such as base drive locomotion and manipulation with KUKA robotic arms. Validated the framework through simulation and practical deployment.

## Modular Snake Robot (2019–2020)
*Authors: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Inspired by the human robotic arm, developed a modular snake robot with 3D-printed components. Achieved desired motion through the Denavit–Hartenberg approach for forward kinematics. Published research paper detailing the design and development process.

## Visual SLAM for Stewart Platform Mechanism (2018–2019)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Worked on Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) for a Stewart Platform, focusing on camera pose estimation, feature detection and matching, visual-LiDAR data fusion, pose-graph optimization, and loop closure detection. Achieved robust image-based camera relocalization for a six-prismatic-joint parallel manipulator.

## Automated Cost-Out Analysis Using Machine Learning (2023)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Developed supervised machine learning algorithms to optimize control factors, achieving critical-to-quality parameters. Delivered $120K in annual cost savings by integrating cost-out analysis for diverse product lines in the electrical and mobility sectors.

## Autonomous Mobile Robot Path Planning (2017–2020)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Developed a multi-robot system for material transport across production lines. Designed and automated pneumatic systems integrated with motor-actuated mechanisms, enabling robust and efficient material handling in production environments.

## Vision-Based PID Control for Robot Manipulators (2019)
*Author: Hrishikesh Nirgude*

Developed joint space control and implemented forward and inverse kinematics with a PID controller for a 3-DOF robot manipulator in Gazebo. Designed a vision-based automation system for turbocharger assembly processes during internship at Honeywell-Garrett.

## Automatic Waste Segregation Dustbin (2018)
*Project Members: Hrishikesh Nirgude, Varun Sundar, Arvind Pujari, Rohith Srinivas, Vishnu Harshith, Sai Venkat, Iniyan Ram*

Designed an automatic waste segregation dustbin using a combination of image features, capacitance, and inductance. Integrated a mechanical disc powered by stepper motors to classify and sort waste into distinct compartments after analysis.

## Self-Balancing Robot (2017–2018)
*Project Members: Hrishikesh Nirgude, Rahul Chakwate, Adil Shaikh, Anuj Sindgi, Atharva Rajadnya*

Developed a one-wheeled self-balancing robot using a tuned Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Leveraged inclination angles and angular velocities as the state vector to maintain balance. Learned core principles of electronics, robotics, and programming.

## Mini Projects:
****************************************
### A list of small projects which required less than a week to work on:
* [**Bass Booster**](https://github.com/hrishi109/Bass-Treble-Booster): Created a Python-based tool to overlay bass in audio files, inspired by bass-boosted audio on YouTube.

* **DeepTraffic**: Participated in MIT’s DeepTraffic competition. Achieved rank 3203 out of 24,449 participants with a speed of 69.18 mph.

* **Games**: Developed several games:
  - Conway's Game of Life
  - Car Racer: Modeled after the DeepTraffic competition.
  - Maze Solver: Solves mazes using image input.
