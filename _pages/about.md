I am a final year undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I am currently working with 
[Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) on improving object detection with reinforcement learning. I am
broadly interested in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Robust Control Theory and I want to contribute something to the world by making new technological products.

I have been fortunate to have interned under [Dr. Harshad Khadilkar](https://sites.google.com/view/harshad/home) at TCS Research and Innovation Lab during my third year undergraduate summer and under Dr. Hannes Gorniaczyk at Daimler AG R&D during my second year undergraduate summer.
