I am currently a MS candidate in the Mechatronics-Robotics Department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI) and working as Research Assistant under Professor Adam Powell (MIT). My research interest lies in Reinforcement Learning, Motion Planning and Computer vision. I am also interested in the interpretability of learning-based methods for autonomous navigation. I have combined tools like multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), graph neural networks, foundational models, and language models for my projects and research.

My MS thesis is on learning-based methods for multi-agent robotics focussing on:

- Scaling MARL in partially observable systems
- Long-horizon planning for multi-agent robotics
- Creating human-interpretable communication protocols for MARL methods

**I am currently on the job market for 2025**.

You can find my publications [here](https://hrishi109.github.io/publications/).

In addition to my research, I am a professional Guitarist and love playing musical instrument piano too. 
I am also into [sketching](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NsuQx0Xl9pQ5V_EsmRd8-qbaLd2zO-Gk), [astrophotography](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IXEQaMT4YNwtfmGf4ktiFaTfVXWCZLqqv2AeThw02LI/edit?usp=sharing), playing tennis, badminton, cricket and swimming.
