I am a final year undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I am currently working with 
[Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) on improving object detection with reinforcement learning. I am
broadly interested in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Robust Control Theory and I want to contribute something to the world by making new technological products.

I interned with  TCS Research and Innovation Lab, Mumbai in the summer of 2019 where I worked with [Dr. Harshad Khadilkar](https://sites.google.com/view/harshad/home) on using reinforcement learning for the online version of 3D bin-packing. I spent the summer of 2018 as a research intern at Daimler AG, Sindelfingen, Germany where I worked with Dr. Hannes Gorniaczyk on finding the optimal camera parameters to capture images such that the object detection performance of pre-trained networks in optimised.
