I am currently a PhD candidate in the AeroAstro Department at MIT. My research interest lies in multi-agent robotics especially in partially observable settings with limited communication bandwidth. I am also interested in the interpretability of learning-based methods for autonomous navigation. I have combined tools like multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), graph neural networks, foundational models, and language models for my research.

My PhD thesis is on learning-based methods for multi-agent robotics focussing on:

- Scaling MARL in partially observable systems
- Long-horizon planning for multi-agent robotics
- Creating human-interpretable communication protocols for MARL methods

**I am currently on the job market for 2025**

In addition to my research, I also like playing musical instruments like guitar, bass, piano, drums, recorder, sketching, astrophotography, playing tennis, badminton, cricket, swimming and going to the gym. You can find some of my guitar videos on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nsidn98_/).
