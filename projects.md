### Reinforcement Learning for Image Quality Improvement for Object Detection:
Abstract: Object Detection performance for a deep network depends a lot on the image quality. Generally images are preprocessed by motion de-blurring, gaussian blurring to remove noise, etc. Not quite a lot of work has been done before on improving the images at the time of it getting captured. A photographer while taking images changes a lot of parameters like shutter speed, gains, aperture to get the best image. Bychkovsky et al[1](http://people.csail.mit.edu/vladb/photoadjust/db_imageadjust.pdf). worked on training a network to come up with image retouches which look pleasing to a human by training it on a dataset which was digitally annotated by expert photographers using photoshop.Yang et al[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02269.pdf). worked on using reinforcement learning to get user based adaptive exposure control to come up with good shutter speeds to capture good images which looked pleasing to humans. This project aims towards making a camera capture images in real-time which are good for a given object detection neural network to increase its performance.[PDF](https://github.com/nsidn98/Reinforcement-Learning-for-Object-Detection)
